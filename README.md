# 🗞️ Text Processing and Information Retrieval

This repository demonstrates key steps in natural language processing and information retrieval using Turkish text data. It covers text tokenization, TF-IDF vectorization, and sparse matrix generation.

📌 This project was submitted as a **midterm replacement assignment** by **Emirkan Beyaz** for the course **"BGG - Bilgi Geri Getirimine Giriş (Introduction to Information Retrieval)"** taken during the **2023–2024 Spring Semester**, taught by **Asst. Prof. Tolga Berber**.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Process Turkish textual data.
- Apply BPE-based tokenization.
- Calculate term frequencies and inverse document frequencies.
- Construct a sparse TF-IDF matrix for information retrieval purposes.
