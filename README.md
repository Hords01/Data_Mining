# Text Processing and Information Retrieval

## Purpose of this repository 
-> Processing text data, applying tokenization, calculating term frequencies, generating a TF-IDF sparse matrix.
-> This is a project to replace midterm exam made by Emirkan Beyaz

This is a class ı did have take in 2023 - 2024 spring semester, given by Asst. Prof. TOLGA BERBER
Named BGG - Bilgi Geri Getirimine Giriş = Introduction to information retrieval
